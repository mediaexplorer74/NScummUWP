# Important

- This is RnD project only with many limitations (original ScummVM is working better)

- This is the synthez of 2 ScummVM UWP ports made by: 1) Scemino; 2) Bashar Astifan

- The extended database added in hope to extend the engines list, even if the new game detected it might not work


# My 2 cents
  
- ARM appx package

- Test resources (LOOM)
 

# Features

- Extended games database (Future usage)

- Add your custom database (As ScummVM.dat)

- Fix some wrong md5 results

- Async loader to avoid UI block

- Export/Import Saves

- Shortcuts for touch screens

- Layouts improvement

- Bugs fixes


#Limitations

- You cannot go back to the games list (for now)

- Actions like clear games list requires app restart

- Cannot delete specific game (for now)


# Known Issue

- GC (Garbage Collector) causing low performance


# Target

To me, it will work with build 15063 on ARM (x64 or x86 cause app halts)
