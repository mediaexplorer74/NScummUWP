# NScummUWP 
The SCUMM UWP client for the Windows 10 (Mobile) platform. :)
    
Download ARM package and LOOM test game (https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/nscumm/releases/tag/1.1.14)

## my 2 cents
1. RnD nSCUMM by scemino (https://github.com/scemino/nscumm)
2. RnD nSCUMMUWP by Bashar Astifan (https://github.com/basharast/NScummUWP) 
3. A Little "refresh" (synthez) of nSCUMM (Win 10 Mobile os "adaptation").
