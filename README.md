# NScummUWP v1.3
The SCUMM UWP client for the Windows 10 (Mobile) platform. :)
    
## my 2 cents
1. RnD nSCUMM by Scemino (https://github.com/scemino/nscumm)
2. RnD nSCUMMUWP by Bashar Astifan (https://github.com/basharast/NScummUWP) 
3. nSCUMM "refubrishing" (SceminoNSCUMM+NSCUMMUWP synthez...)
4. Some "project optimization" applied (reducing srccode's filesize from 166mb to 32mb)
5. ru_RU local. added
6. Game-loop (run cycle) stability increazed
7. Experimental mode added (game engine "zero", or "0") for veeery oooldes dos games support :)

## Build instructions
1. First, check that you have the [necessary tools](#requirements) installed.
2. Clone the repo `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/NScummUWP.git`.
3. Update all project dependencies (packages) 
4. Compile the UWP app for needed platform (ARM is best one... but x86 is supported too)
5. Try to load some SCUMMVM-compatible game, i.e. "The Curse of Monkey Island (Windows CD)"
6. Test & enjoy game process, sound tracks, oldschool cool graphics, etc.... =))
 

## Requirements
The following tools and SDKs are mandatory for the project development:
* Visual Studio 2022 Preview, with
    * .NET Native;
    * .NET Framework 4.8 SDK;
    * NuGet package manager;
    * Universal Windows Platform tools;
    * Windows 10 19041 SDK;
    * Min. os. build can/must be set to 15063 (or even 10240) for all Universal projects 


## Current features
- Audio / sounds seem(s) to be ok
- Project Astoria compatibility added (uwp projects switched to win 10 10240 "mode")

## Planned features
- Check & fix audio plugins (i.e. LOOM goes at no-sound... so strange)
